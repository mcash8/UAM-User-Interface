# UAM-User-Interface
A user interface created for monitoring a manufacturing process.  This was part of my senior capstone design project. This is the code as of 5/10/2020. The overall goal was to build a machine that used an ultrasonic driver to weld strips of metal together.  My main responsibility was to design two user interfaces.  The first UI, G-Code.mlapp, allows the user to input print specifications.  The UI calls an algorithm, GCode.m, which prints a .txt file of G Code that is manually uploaded to a Haas CNC mini mill. After this, a second user interface appears that plots weld data as the process occurs. Behind the scene, the process is being videoed and weld data is being written to a text file. Every five seconds, weld data is sent to ThingSpeak IoT for remote viewing. Once the process ends, the weld data and video are uploaded to Google Drive. 
A major improvement I would make is to change the programming langugae used for the project.  Due to time constraints and having other responsibilities for the project, I went with the programming environment I was most familar with, Matlab. I recognize that Matlab isn't optimized for what I did, but given more time to research and learn a new language, I would've used C# or Python.
